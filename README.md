# Description
Hours spent: 3
Using the google cloud SDK I created the HMN Admin VM and the one required honeypot. The honeypot was left open for a short amount of time and gathered 328 attacks. The honeypot deploeyed followed the HTTP Dionaea script and was left on for about half an hour in order to gather data and attacks. Attakcs varied from all over the world as well as from my local IP using
the Kali VM. As soon as the script was ran attacks came in slowly. There were 328 registered attacks when i coppied the seesion.json file to my local machine. By the time I shut down the server and was ready to remove the vms from google cloud there were over 1200 total registered attacks. I did not encounter any errors in setup and gathering data.
